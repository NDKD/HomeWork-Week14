Which model has a lower loss?
LSTM RNN on stock predictor on closing was showing the loss: 0.0534 whereas STM RNN on stock predictor FNG was showing the loss of 20.44

Which model tracks the actual values better over time? 
LSTM RNN on stock predictor on closing tracks gave the better predictions , thus tracks the actual values better over time.

Which window size works best for the model?
window_size = 10 works best out of the two models that were evaluated.
